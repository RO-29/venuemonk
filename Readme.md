VenueMonk Web Development Problem Statement
================================
You are required to develop a working, no-frills prototype of a web application with database
connectivity, input validation along with support for result sorting & filtering records.
Though it’s not necessary, but you can use this opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of
developing scalable systems, secure web-development or any of the other cool stuff you are good at.

Use Case & Expectation:
1. The user should be able to filter & sort the venues on the website according to price.
2. On clicking any venue on the list page, the corresponding venue profile page should open.
3. To add more venues, one should be able to fill a form on the backend to enter the above
mentioned 5 details for a venue and on submitting, it should be reflected on the frontend.
4. We are fine with even the most basic version of frontend which can support the above
functionality. It is a test of your web-application development prowess not your UI skills; though
it won’t harm you if have a good eye for aesthetics and a way with CSS/SCSS.
Technical Requirements:

●We’d prefer that you use the LAMP/WAMP (Linux/Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack to
develop this prototype.

●We want your working code to be deployed on any free/owned web-space for an easy
demonstration. (You can use the AWS free tier to host your prototype, if you like)

●And the code should be available for review on any of the open code hosting providers like
github, or you could just zip the files and mail it to us.
